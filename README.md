📊 Amazon Sales Analytics Dashboard - Power BI Project
This is my first project using Power BI, where I have analyzed an Amazon sales dataset to uncover trends, profits, and sales distributions. The dashboard provides an interactive and visual representation of the dataset, helping stakeholders quickly understand sales performance over time and across categories and regions.

The Amazon Sales Analytics Dashboard provides insights into:
📅 Sales over time (by order date)
📦 Sales distribution by product category
🌎 Profit contribution by state

🧾 Key metrics including:
Total Order Count
Total Sales
Total Profit
